# 🎮 MazeStrike

MazeStrike is an **AI-powered maze navigation game** developed using the **Godot Game Engine**.  
The core objective of the game is to guide the player through complex maze environments while leveraging **path-finding algorithms** to determine optimal movement paths and intelligent navigation behavior.

The project demonstrates the practical application of **Artificial Intelligence algorithms in games**, specifically focusing on **graph traversal and path-finding techniques** to solve navigation problems in a dynamic environment.

## 🧠 AI & Algorithmic Concept

MazeStrike implements **AI-based path finding** to handle maze traversal logic.  
The maze is treated as a **grid/graph structure**, where:

- Each cell/node represents a possible movement position  
- Walls act as blocked nodes  
- Paths are computed to determine valid and optimal routes  

The AI logic ensures:
- Intelligent decision-making for movement
- Efficient navigation from start to goal
- Avoidance of dead ends and obstacles

This makes MazeStrike an excellent demonstration of **AI algorithms applied to real-time game scenarios**.
