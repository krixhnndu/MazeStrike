# 🎮 MazeStrike

MazeStrike is an **AI-powered maze navigation game** developed using the **Godot Game Engine**.
The core objective is to guide the player through complex maze environments by leveraging **path-finding algorithms** to determine optimal movement paths and intelligent navigation behavior.

This project demonstrates the practical application of **Artificial Intelligence algorithms in games**, focusing on **graph traversal and path-finding techniques** to solve navigation problems in dynamic environments.

## 🧠 AI & Algorithmic Concept

MazeStrike implements **AI-based path finding** to handle maze traversal logic. The maze is modeled as a **grid/graph structure** where:

* Each cell/node represents a potential movement position
* Walls act as blocked nodes
* Paths are computed to determine valid and optimal routes

The AI logic ensures:

* Intelligent decision-making for player movement
* Efficient navigation from start to goal
* Avoidance of dead ends and obstacles

This makes MazeStrike an excellent example of **AI algorithms applied to real-time game scenarios**.
